## what

Experimentation is key to learning, but I also understand the importance of shipping finished products. I want to show three projects that I value the most.

In these projects, I collaborated closely with engineers and designers. While I wasn't the leading designer, I developed them and played a crucial role in determining what effects and interactions we could add to make them more engaging and better communicate their concepts.

### Vercel Ship

https://vercel.com/ship

In my latest project, I helped implement the registration flow, payments, analytics, CMS integrations, and some cool using WebGL.

To keep loading times quick, The letters are first animated with SVG elements, then switched to the WebGL version as soon as the renderer is ready. With this effect, we won an [Element of the Day Awwward](https://www.awwwards.com/sites/vercel-ship)!

And, of course, there is always some space for extra experimentation...

### Kidsuper World

https://kidsuper.world/

This project offers a 3D immersive journey, allowing you to explore the KidSuper shop through engaging interactions with paintings and portals. The experience starts with a painting that vividly portrays the outdoors of their Brooklyn-based store. This is followed by a photo-realistic representation of the store's interior.

The concept of "live paintings" is explored in multiple ways. The paints on the walls serve as portals to other dimensions, encouraging the user to explore the entirety of the store.

We had a lot of good feedback from this project, and also we won two sites of the day.

### Basement chronicles

https://chronicles.basement.studio/

In my first project with Basement, I helped create **Basement Chronicles**, a point-and-click adventure for the web.

For this project, I helped implement the Boss Scene and the game's post-processing effects.
