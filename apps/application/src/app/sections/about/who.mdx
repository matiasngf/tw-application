## who

My name is Matias Gonzalez Fernandez. I am a developer based in **Buenos Aires, Argentina (UTC-3)**. I live with my girlfriend and three adorable cats. I have a **Graphic Design Degree** and have been a developer for a couple of years. _I'm always trying to find the sweet spot between the two worlds._

My journey into web development began back in **2015** while working in Human Resources at the [National Congress](https://hcdn.gob.ar/). I remember learning **PHP** because I wanted to automate some repetitive tasks at work. It's been an incredible journey since then!

Back then, I also volunteered at [Atomic Lab](https://atomiclab.org/EN/index.html), which prints **3D prostheses** for kids. They needed help with an **ASP.NET** project's front end, so I learned how to use **Razor** to make the UI. After that, I switched to working with **React, Webpack, Styled Components**, and eventually, **tailwindcss**. For many years, I was used to building with PHP as a backend that served a React app to the front end until **NextJs** arrived to make our lifes easier.

**Volunteering** was a crucial part of my career; I learned the most about teamwork at [TEDx](https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/tedx-program). I helped organize some TEDx events in Argentina. In 2017, I led [TEDxHCDN](https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/22230), an event held at the National Congress. My role as organizer was to build an internal team with people from all across the organization. I coordinated **budget, production, design, communications, selecting speakers, and helping them with their talks**.

After several years as a developer, I took the lead on a **team of five people**, which included both designers and developers. Our main goal was to digitalize many internal processes previously handled on paper. We **prototyped, tested, and conducted user interviews** to ensure a smooth transition with the best UX possible. Additionally, I played a key role in **interviewing** and hiring these team members.

Nowadays, I'm working as a "creative developer" at Basement Studio, where we use WebGL, Gap, NextJs, and, of course, tailwind to create awesome web experiences.
