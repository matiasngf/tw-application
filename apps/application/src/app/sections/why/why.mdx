## why

I decided to apply for this job because my skill set perfectly balances being a graphic designer and having vast experience in engineering. Plus, who wouldn't want to help build one of the most influential tools for front-end development today?

### Some key points about me

**I love a good DX.** That's why, whenever I create new components or APIs, I aim to make them easy for other developers (including my future self) to use. I also value when an API is "hackable" so people can extend it it their needs.

**I like building tools.** I recently published the plugin [tailwindcss-text-scale](https://npmjs.com/package/tailwindcss-text-scale). Its goal is to let users scale typography between screen breakpoints by adding classNames like `text-scale-lg/4xl`, making the font grow from lg to 4xl between the `sm-screen` and `2xl-screen` breakpoints. You can also customize the position of the breakpoints by adding `text-screen-xl/lg`.

**I can create POCs.** I published a small experiment called [carpincho](https://www.npmjs.com/package/carpincho) that allows you to Build backend applications with zero configuration. Inspired by NextJs, you can use folders and filenames to define routes.

**I love to experiment.** I like researching and implementing weird
experiments to learn new things. For example, I created an esoteric language called "EmoJS." It allows you to **code with emojis** (then it transpiles into JS to run in Node); in fact, it is used in the source code of this page. Don't believe me? [Check out the source here!](https://github.com/matiasngf/tw-application/blob/main/apps/application/README.md) The origin of this experiment was to play around with **tokenizers** and learn how to create a custom **Webpack loader**
and a **transpiler CLI**.

**I am a designer.** Every design tells a story, and that story is how the user feels after navigating a piece. This is why I think about the user journey and all the possible scenarios that a person might encounter, focusing on balance and accessibility.

**I write.** I usually post on my experiments page and write case studies. I encourage you to read ["Growing plants with code"](https://matiasgf.dev/experiments/shaders-plants), where I go through creating procedural plants (used on this site), and ["Kidsuper World: bringing paints to life with r3f."](https://basement.studio/blog/kidsuper-world-bringing-paints-to-life-with-r3f)

_This section of the site was the hardest for me. I'm not an expert in every area required for the job; on the contrary, I probably need to keep improving in every area, but I am good at learning, knowing my limitations, and taking feedback._
