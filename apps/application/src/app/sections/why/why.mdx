## why

I decided to apply for this job because my skill set perfectly balances being a graphic designer and having vast experience in engineering. Plus, who wouldn't want to help build one of the most influential tools for front-end development today?

### Some key points about me

**I love a good DX.** That's why, whenever I create new components or APIs, I aim to make them easy for other developers (including my future self) to use. I also value when an API is "hackable" so people can extend it it their needs.

**I like building tools.** I recently published the plugin [tailwindcss-text-scale](https://npmjs.com/package/tailwindcss-text-scale). Its goal is to let users scale typography between screen breakpoints by adding classNames like `text-scale-lg/4xl`, making the font grow from lg to 4xl between the `sm-screen` and `2xl-screen` breakpoints. You can also customize the position of the breakpoints by adding `text-screen-xl/lg`.

**I can create POCs.** I published a small experiment called [carpincho](https://www.npmjs.com/package/carpincho) that allows you to Build backend applications with zero configuration. Inspired by NextJs, you can use folders and filenames to define routes.

**I love to experiment.** I like researching and implementing weird
experiments to learn new things. For example, I created an esoteric language
called "EmoJS." It allows you to **code with emojis** (then it transpiles into
JS to run in Node); in fact, it is used in the source code of this page. Don't
believe me? Check out the source here! The origin of this experiment was to
play around with **tokenizers** and learn how to create a custom **Webpack loader**
and **transpiler**.
